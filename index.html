        <p>Logan Alexander Paul[1] (born April 1, 1995) is an American actor, director, and internet personality. He first gained fame through videos shared on the internet video service Vine.[2][3]

After the discontinuation of Vine, Paul began a daily video series on YouTube under the name "Logan Paul Vlogs". Paul successfully vlogged every day from September 12, 2016 to January 1, 2018. Paul also branched out into acting in television and films. His television work includes a guest appearance on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and a role in the comedy series Weird Loners. His film work includes the dystopian science fiction YouTube Red film The Thinning and the adult comedy Airplane Mode.

Paul has been involved in several controversies regarding his videos, the most notable of which was when he filmed the corpse of a man who committed sucide in Aokigahara, Japan. This led to massive criticism from celebrities, politicians and other YouTubers, and Paul taking a three-week break from making videos.</p>
